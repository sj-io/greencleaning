# How clean is clean?

Most cleaning jobs only need soap or detergent, water, and a little elbow grease. Some surfaces may need extra attention to control germs.

**Sanitizers** reduce, but do not totally eliminate germs but are usually safer to use.

**Disinfectants** destroy or inactivate germs but tend to be more toxic and must be used with care.

**Always label all cleaners clearly!!!**
