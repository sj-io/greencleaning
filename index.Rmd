# About {.unnumbered}

The information in this book was originally created by the University of Georgia Cooperative Extension, and was adapted by Martha Keel, Ph.D., and Bonnie Hinds, M.S., of the University of Tennessee's Extension into a recipe book. This online version was created by [Sarah Johnson](https://sarahjohnson.io/) after receiving the recipe book from Sharon Hyde of the Green & Healthy Homes Initiative.
